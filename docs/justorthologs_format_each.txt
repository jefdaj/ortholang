WARNING! This one is fragile in that you have to manually make sure the two input lists match up.
         If they don't, it will at least try to fail rather than giving nonsense results.
         I recomend writing the lists directly in the source code, or loading them from text files.
         Avoid globbing or set operations, which might randomly re-order them.

This is one reliable way to write the lists out. They're easy to visually check:

formatted_genomes = justorthologs_format_each
                      ["speciesA.gff3" , "speciesB.gff3" , "speciesC.gff3" ]
                      ["speciesA.fasta", "speciesB.fasta", "speciesC.fasta"]

The other reliable way is to create separate text files:

formatted_genomes = justorthologs_format_each
                      (load_gff_each (load_list "gffs.txt"))
                      (load_faa_each (load_list "faas.txt"))

This is an example of an *unreliable* way to do it:

formatted_genomes = justorthologs_format_each
                      (load_gff_glob "species*.gff3")
                      (load_faa_glob "species*.fasta")

If you go that route, check that the lists are correct in the REPL before
running your searches. Also note that it might work now, but stop working if
someone adds files with a different naming scheme later.
